# vim-config

A minimal setup for vim.


Installs the following packages:
* [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)
* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
* [vim-airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes)
* [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
* [vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors)
* [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)


**Note:** vim-airline needs a _powerline_ font to render correctly. This script installs powerline fonts, but you still have to select one in your terminal preferences.
